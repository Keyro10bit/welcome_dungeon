      <h2><b>Intergration of both Versions</b></h2><span class="code">  </span>•
      Despite what it says on the box, the two games are not truly compatible.
      Though you are able to use the Heroes in both Dungeons, you need to use a
      provided card to translate some of the icons. <br><span class="code">  </span>
      • If you want to use the WBttD "special" monsters, you must the WBttD dungeon
      deck.<br><br><b>Custom Variant</b><br><br><span class="code">  </span>• There
      is a popular variant on the geek where the Dungeon Cards are mixed into a
      single deck. Though if you want to hide the decks you need opaque card sleeves.
      Also, add 4 special monsters.<br><span class="code">  </span>• This Variant uses
      2 Heroes at a time instead of 1.<br><span class="code">  </span>• All other rules
      are basically the same.<br><span class="code">  </span>• The variant is as follows:<br><br>

      <b>*Monster Deck*</b><br>
      Combine both decks together and shuffle in 4 of the special monsters from WBttD.
      You can throw opaque card backs on them if you want, for completely hidden knowledge.
      You can also leave the different backs open; it almost adds an additional layer of
      strategy in my opinion. Seeing your opponent pull out a WBttD card back could mean
      there is one less special monster.
      <br><br>
      <b>*Characters*</b><br>
      -Bidding Phase-<br>
      You start with 2 fully equipped characters, and can openly pull any equipment
      when you keep a monster card (putting it in front of you). One character can
      have 0 equipment while the other still has all 6, no limits there. Other than
      that, the Bidding Phase" is done the same
      <br>-Dungeon Phase-<br>
      Remains mostly the same, but you choose which character fights the monster
      for each dungeon card flip. Choosing before flipping or after flipping.
      Both work, each offering a different train of thought, so try both. Only
      one hero needs to survive for a trophy to be awarded. Additional damage
      beyond what kills one character DOES NOT carry over to the surviving hero.
      <br><br>

      <br><b>!! Mimics</b> consider all active equipment from both characters for their ability.
      <br><b>!! Shapeshifters</b> added early can be incredibly powerful, so
      if you put one in, make sure you bow out gracefully next round (with a sly grin of course)
      <br><b>!!"Text As Written"</b> on equipment cards. Abilities like Necromancer's
      Reanim Bones, Poss Scroll & Bloody Wand specifically state "When YOU die . . ."
      or "YOUR new hp . . .". In those cases they are only able to affect the hero
      the equipment belongs to (Health Potions as well). On the other hand the Ninja's
      Smoke Bomb simply says ". . . a different Equipment tile.", so you could
      essentially discard the other Character's tile.
      <br><b>!!Barbarian Torch</b> WILL kill Strength 3 or less monsters from WBttD
      even though they do not have the torch symbol, and vice-versa. As stated above,
      "Text As Written" first and foremost. If it says it will kill STR 3 or less, it does.
      <br><br>
      <b>\Positives/</b>
      <br>
      -I enjoy the longer bidding/dungeon phases. You can really sway the chances
      by adding/removing a single monster depending on what character combos are
      out there. But then, with certain combos, you can really trudge pretty deep into the Dungeon.
      <br>
      -Having 2 characters offers tons of variety depending on what 2 characters
      you choose to party together. Some work great, some not too great . . .
      but you have a lot more to think about when choosing to draw or pass.
      <br>
      -Ummm . . . YOU CAN ACTUALLY FULLY COMBINE BOTH GAMES!!!
      <br><br>
      <b>\Negatives/</b>
      <br>
      -Some items are less useful (Mage's Omnipotence)
      <br>
      -Some items are much more powerful (Vorpal items and Royal Scepter)
      <br><br><b>Extra Rule</b><br><span class="code">  </span>• Same as the
      Custom Variant above, but during Hero Selection as a group, the players
      select skill cards so all icons are UNIQUE. So you can not have 2 different
      tokens both showing the "flame" icon for example. <br><br><span style="font-size: 14pt;">
      <b>Rule Clarifications</b></span><br><br><span class="code">  </span>
      • On a player's turn they can choose to pass or draw a card. When everyone
      has passed but one player, that last player enters the dungeon.
      <br><span class="code">  </span>• If the dungeon deck runs out and there
      is more than 1 player who has not yet chosen to pass, the current player
      who normally would be drawing a card form the depleted monster deck
      <b>is forced</b> to pass. This continues until there is only 1 player
      who has not passed.<br><span class="code">         </span>• There is a
      house rule that just says all the players who have not passed when the
      monster deck runs out enter at once and decide as a team on when to use
      items. They all receive wounds on a fail and all receive a treasure on win.
      This can create ties for gaining 2 treasure, simply continue play until
      there is one player who is 1 ahead.<br><br><span class="code">  </span>
      • If you choose not to pass you must draw a card <b>This card is kept
      secret from all the other players</b><br><span class="code">  </span>
      • You may choose to simply place this card face down on the dungeon
      deck or you may choose to discard it.<br><span class="code">  </span>
      • To discard the card you must also discard an equipment token form
      the hero's inventory.<br><span class="code">  </span>• You can not ever
      discard the named hero card itself.<br><br><span class="code">  </span>
      • When entering the dungeon <b>do not shuffle the dungeon deck formed
      in the previous phase</b><br><span class="code">  </span>• Automatically
      defeat any monsters encountered in the monster deck that have matching
      icons to your remaining hero cards. You <b>do not</b> discard the hero
      card unless the card itself instructs you. So a single card with the flame
      icon will defeat ALL monsters in the dungeon with a flame icon on them.
      <br><span class="code">  </span>• The health tokens <b>are not ever
      discarded.</b> in this phase, though you can discard them in the
      previous phase to stop cards entering the dungeon deck.
      <br><span class="code">  </span>• The remaining tokens in the hero
      line when you enter the dungeon tell you your health pool value.
      In WBttD they have provided a small helper card to track health points.
      <br><span class="code">  </span>• The value on the monster card is
      the damage that monster dose if it is not defeated. You simply play
      until your health is &gt;1. <br><br><span style="font-size: 14pt;">
      <b>Specific Card Clarifications</b></span><br><br><b>The Pollymorph
      Spell</b><br><br><span class="code">  </span>• The Pollymorph spell
      references the "next" card. This comes from the <b>Monster Deck</b>
      not the "dungeon deck". <br><span class="code">  </span>• If there
      is no cards left in the monster deck, as they are all in the dungeon
      or discarded during the bidding phase, then Pollymorph can not resolve at all.
      <br><br><b>Vorpal Sword</b><br><div class="quotetitle">Quote:</div>
      <div class="quote">Defeat one monster that you choose before entering the dungeon</div>
      <br>  • Remember the dungeon deck is <b>not</b> shuffled and is face down.
      <br>  • The player names an enemy type, with out looking in the dungeon deck.
      <br>  • <b>All</b> monsters of this type are removed when encountered.
